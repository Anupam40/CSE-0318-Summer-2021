\section{Introduction}
The ‘MCQ Quiz Application’ project will be developed to overcome the time consuming problem of manual system. Apart from that in current system, checking the answer sheets after taking test, waste the examiners time, so this application will check the correct answer and save the examiner time and carry the examination in an effective manner. The users which are use this system don’t need to high computing knowledge and  also system will  inform them  while entering invalid data

\section{Literature Review}
The  main objective  of  the  project  MCQ  Quiz  Application  is to  manage  the  details of students, examinations, marks, courses and papers. The project is totally at administrative end and thus only the administrator is granted the access. The purpose of the project is to build an application to reduce the manual work for managing the MCQ quiz and we will follow to achieve these objectives in this project.   - To create an appropriate platform for best managing of MCQ test; - To overcome the time consuming issues and taking MCQ tests; - To release themarks of the test taker as soon as possible; -  To manage the information of different tests
.

\section{Proposed Methodology}

The  methodology  of  developing  of  project  will  be  a  step-by-step  sequence  to  design, develop and deliver the application. In software engineering this methodology called ‘waterfall model’ which one portion of work follows after another in a linear sequence. Following steps will be followed in this methodology: - Initiation (Requirement Specification); - Planning and design; - Execution (construction and coding); - Validation (Testing); - Closure (Installation and Maintenance
